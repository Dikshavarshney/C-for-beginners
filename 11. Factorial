/*~~~~  Explanation of Program ~~~~

Declared variables num,i and f=1 as integers;

Print message to ask number;

Stored entered value to num;

Used for loop{
  i=num(i is eqaul to num); 
  i>1(i is greater than 1),
       when i become smaller than 1, the loop teminate;
  i--(i's decreament);

  print the i, 
        i.e.-->(number)X(number-1)X(number-2)-------2;

  f = f *i;
 }
 
print 1;
Print the Factorial of num;
